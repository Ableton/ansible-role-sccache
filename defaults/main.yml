# Dictionary of dictionaries describing key/value options to write to the sccache
# configuration file. sccache is configured with a TOML format, which requires a section
# for key/value pairs. At the time of writing, documentation of the format is slim,
# and most configuration options must be read from the parsing code itself:
# https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/blob/master/src/config.rs.
# Note that all values should be quoted so that Ansible treats them as strings. With
# boolean values, this is especially problematic because Python will serialize `true` as
# "True", and sccache values are case-sensitive and may exit with an error when parsing
# that option.
#
# For example, to set a Redis cache, sccache_config_options could be set as follows:
#   sccache_config_options:
#      cache:
#        redis.url: "redis://your-redis-server-here"
sccache_config_options: {}

# Where to download prebuilt sccache binaries from
sccache_download_url: "https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/releases/download"

# When true, install sccache from a prebuilt binary instead of installing from a package
# manager.
sccache_install_from_binary: false

# User to configure sccache for
sccache_user: "{{ ansible_user }}"

# Version and SHA256 checksums of sccache to install. Only applies when installing from
# GitHub.
